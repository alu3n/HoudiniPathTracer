# Development Documentation
## Basics
### Technologies
The software is compiled as a plugin for a commercial 3D graphics software [SideFX Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com). Main programming language of the project is C++ 17. The only external library used for this project is the [Houdini Development Kit](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/hdk/) which is used by the developers at SideFX to develop Houdini.

Build system used for the project is [CMake](https://cmake.org). For more information about compiling Houdini plugins you can visit [HDK: Compiling HDK Code](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/hdk/_h_d_k__intro__compiling.html).

### Algorithms
#### Path Tracing
The core algorithm of the renderer is pathtracing, which is described in multiple articles and books (e.g. books mentioned in the resources sections).

Notable modification to the algorithm is that, light sources aren’t treated as geometry, but are treated as separate entities. During the computation of intersection point algorithm choses one of the lights (uniform probability) and generates sample on the light surface (also uniform probability). The sample is then used to compute direct illumination at the point.  This can be seen in the file `PhysicallyBasedRenderer.cpp` int the method `ComputeDirectIllumination`.

### Project Structure
Projects root folder contains the following folders and files
**`/Compilation`**
This folder contains things related to debuging and compilation.

**`/Documentation`**
This folder contains detailed documentation.

**`/Samples`**
This folder contains sample houdini files to test out the plugin.

**`/Sources`**
This folder contains source code for the plugin itself.

### Data transfer
#### Houdini -> Plugin
The plugin is represented in Houdini as a ROP (Rendering Operator) node, whose parameters are treated as input to the plugin.  The parameters are combination of numeric parameters and links to builtin Houdini nodes.

Once user presses the render button, those nodes are processed and transformed into scene elements. If the conversion was succesful scene is then rendered - this is done in `RenderInterface.cpp`.

#### Plugin -> Houdini
During rendering renderer progressively improves rendered image, which is displayed to MPlay window. Implementation of this can be seen in `RenderWindow.cpp`

### Resources
Resources used during implementation are the following lectures and books.
#### Books
- [Fundamentals of Computer Graphics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1933732.Fundamentals_of_Computer_Graphics)
- [Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation](https://www.pbr-book.org)
- [Ray Tracing Gems Series](https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracinggems/)

#### Lectures
- [Fotorealistická grafika (NPGR004)](https://cgg.mff.cuni.cz/lectures/npgr004.cz.php)
- [Advanced 3D Graphics for Movies and Games](https://cgg.mff.cuni.cz/courses/advanced-3d-graphics-for-movies-and-games/)

## Compilation
### Compilation scripts
There are two scripts used to compile the projects. In order for them to work you have to set the environment variables.
#### `Build.sh`
This script builds the plugin. It **should** put the plugin into the houdini plugin folder automatically.

#### `BuildDebug.sh`
This script does the same thing as previous one, but also opens Houdini with the debug scene. It is useful for faster debuging of the plugin.

### Environment variables
Before compiling the project you have to set a few environemnt variables. You have to do so in the file `Compilation/config.env`.
- **`HFS`**
  - This variable can be provided via typing `echo $HFS` to the **Houdini Terminal**
- **`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`**
  - This variable is path to the cmake folder in the HFS (it will probably be `${HFS}/toolkit/cmake`)
- **`HOUDINI_BINARY_PATH`** (optional - needed only if you want to compile using `BuildDebug.sh`)
  - This is path to the binary file of the houdini application itself (used to start houdini)
- **`DEBUG_SCENE_PATH`** (optional - needed only if you want to compile using `BuildDebug.sh`)
  - This is path to the scene you want to start using `BuildDebug.sh`

### Setting up IDE
You might have to set variables in `HFS` and `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` in the `CMakeLists.txt` if you want your IDE to be able to load the project properly.

## Source Code Structure
The project code is divided into two main parts - `Source/Core` which contains code that is used by the rendering algorithm  itself and `Source/Hook` that contains code for direct comunication with Houdini.

Both of the folders are in turn devided on subfolders depending on usecase of the code inside. All of the subfolders contain `Sources/x/y/include` and `Sources/x/y/sources` folder, first is to store header files and later is to store source files implementing those header files.

### `Sources/Core`
#### `/Materials`
This folder is intended to store classes and functions related to textures, materials, reflection models etc.

#### `/Mathematics`
This folder is intended to store classes and functions doing mathematical computations - such as generating random samples or normalizing vectors.

#### `/Physics`
This folder is intended to store classes and functions doing or supporting physical computations such as computing ideal reflections, units for storing energy etc.

#### `/Renderers`
This folder contains render engine itself and some classes which help with storing of rendered images.

#### `/Scene`
This folder contains scene elements such as cameras, lights, geometry etc.

### `Sources/Hook`
#### `/Nodes`
This folder stores implementation of the renderer node interface.

#### `/Other`
This folder stores functions and classes that provide means of communication between the render engine and houdini application, as well as support methods for hooking the plugin into houdini.

## Extending Functionality
### Changing the rendering algorithm
Entire rendering algorithm is in the file `PhysicallyBasedRenderer.cpp`.  If you want change it you should do that here.

### Changing the BxDFs
You can change BxDFs in the `BxDF.cpp`. There are both methods for evaluating BRDF/BTDF as well as generating sample direction.

### Adding materials
To create a new material you have to make it a public child of `Material` class.  You have to implement `Evaluate` method which is purely virtual in the base class. You’re free to output any `TextureData` as long its values are inside the boundaries for texture data.

I. e., each individual parameter in the `TextureData` has to be in the interval [0,1]. With the exception of `RGBEnergy` whose values are in [0,1]^3.  For example of implementation check out `ProceduralTiles` in the file `MaterialLibrary.cpp`.

After implementing the material you have to register it into the texture hashmap. This is done in the file `PhysicallyBasedRenderer.cpp` in the renderers constructor. You have to pick keyword which isn’t in the hashmap yet as a key.

### Adding scene elements
#### New Elements
If you want to add entirely new scene element you can use one of the existing scene elements as reference e.g. `Camera`.

#### Lights
You might also want to implement different light than the default one (`ConstantRectangularLight`). In that case you should use `Light` as a base clase and implement its `GenerateSample` method.  This light may then be added to the scene during the light loading in the `RenderInterface.cpp`.

### Changing the node interface
If you want to change node interface you can do so in the `RendererNode.cpp`.  More information on node interfaces is available in the [HDK: Working with Parameters](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/hdk/_h_d_k__node_intro__working_with_parameters.html). After adding new parameters correct place to access them is the `RenderInterface.cpp`.
